### Hand Gesture Recognition from a Sigle Depth image
This repository contains code for the hand gesture recognition mentioned in the paper: [Deep gesture interaction for augmented anatomy learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217308678)

#### Dataset
The [Creative Senz3D](https://lttm.dei.unipd.it/downloads/gesture/#senz3d)  dataset contains gestures performed by 4 different people, each performing 11 different gestures repeated 30 times each, for a total of 1320 samples. For each sample, color, depth and confidence frames are available. Intrinsic parameters for the Creative Senz3D are also provided.
